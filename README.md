# swapy_project
Simple project by using Spring Framework, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf. I called this project Swap'y, because idea of this project was analogue OLX.

If we look to architecture of this project, we can see the using Spring Data Jpa, Spring Security( Bcypt ), Spring MVC. Project built with Spring Boot to make it easy to build and focus on features.

P.S: I don't senior or even middle java developer. I am still learning web-development using Spring and Java.
